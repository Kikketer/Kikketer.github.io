This is a small desktop (electron) app that kind of works.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Kikketer/CardStudio">Repo</a></p><h2>Card Studio Idea</h2><p><img src="../../images/card-studio-shot.png" alt="Card Studio Overview"></p><p>There are many days where my son will attempt to build a board game. I love this since I've attempted this same thing many many times without much success (see <a href="./skylight-game">Skylight Game</a> and <a href="./catapults-game">Catapults Game</a>). He proposed this pretty fantastic and simple game based on his love for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/92037-wings-of-fire">Wings of Fire</a>.</p><p>During the creation of the game I wanted to have a way to quickly generate the playing cards. I know that <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com">The Game Crafter</a> created an application called <a href="https://component.studio/">Component Studio</a> which serves the purpose of building game components. This product has a monthly fee and since I change projects nearly daily, it didn't make much sense financially.</p><p>But I'm cheap and I like to build things. I decided to attempt to build a desktop version of the application with the intent that this is free, easy and gets the job done well enough.</p><h2>The Goals</h2><p>The goals were simple:</p><ul><li>Allow the user to build a &quot;master&quot; template of the cards</li><li>Read a CSV document to generate the cards</li><li>Allow the use of a drag/drop style interaction to design the cards</li><li>Run entirely on the desktop, allowing a user to have a project that could be easily shared (think Github)</li></ul><h3>The User Flow</h3><p>A user would open a &quot;project&quot; file, likely a JSON5 document (I love JSON5). This project file would have all the needed meta-data like project title and the like but also the definitions and descriptions for each &quot;deck&quot;.</p><p>The user then would be able to edit the &quot;master&quot; file of a deck which is sort of like a template for the entire deck. Using a specially crafted variable input they would be able to use the values that existed in the CSV document.</p><p>Lastly the user would be able to click the &quot;generate&quot; button and would get a series of images that are &quot;Game Crafter ready&quot; that they could use to upload or print.</p><h2>The Tools</h2><p>Through building this application I used the following tools:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>: The foundation to make your web application be a desktop application. This technique isn't new and is used by many applications today.</li><li><a href="https://konvajs.org/">Konva</a>: A great canvas library that allows you to draw on an HTML canvas.</li></ul><p><img src="../../images/card-studio-drag-drop.gif" alt="Drag and Drop in Konva"></p><h2>The &quot;Conclusion&quot;</h2><p>I've since moved away from this project since new things have landed on my plate. The game did make it all the way to <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/dragon-world">The Game Crafter</a> but didn't use Card Studio directly.</p><p>I did however generate the cards used in the game using the same tools, I just didn't use the IDE that I was intending to build.</p><p>Lastly this project is a bit paused right now mostly because I've not updated my OS on my MacBook Air and it seems the SASS dependencies no longer compile for the project.</p><h2>The Learnings</h2><p>I had a couple ah-ha moments when I realized that I could use a standard mindset of a network API to generate the cards without having to view the page each time.</p><p>Previous adventures in this type of thing required me to render the entire card on a visible HTML page to export it as a .png file. This involved an annoying process of having to click each card and then click a &quot;download&quot; button.</p><p>The solution was to have the cards render on the &quot;client&quot; (renderer) but hidden and their base64 encoded result would be sent to the &quot;backend&quot; (main) of Electron. From there the file can be saved directly to the file system.</p><p><img src="../../images/card-studio-to-64.png" alt="Output using base64"></p><h2>The Future</h2><p>I do plan to continue working on this fun project but I always need more inspiration. My kids are the source of all my inspiration and I'll likely come back to this project once my son decides to build yet another game.</p></div><aside aria-label="Post metadata" class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/unfinished-project/">#unfinished-project</a> <a href="/tags/code/">#code</a> <a href="/tags/board-game/">#board-game</a></div><nav aria-label="Post" class="post__pagination"><a aria-label="Read older post: Pokemon Rescue" href="/posts/pokemon-rescue/"><span aria-hidden="true" role="img" aria-label="arrow left">←</span>Pokemon Rescue </a><a aria-label="Read newer post: Catapults Game" href="/posts/catapults-game/">Catapults Game<span aria-hidden="true" role="img" aria-label="arrow right">→️</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/Kikketer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Chris Weed 2021</p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
