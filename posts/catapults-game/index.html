Inspired by the NES game &quot;...&quot; I created a fun little game that can mostly be created by anyone with a 3D printer.</p><h2>The Game</h2><p>Time to start writing stuff!</p><h2>Designing the Components</h2><p>Boom</p><h2>Proposing to Publishers</h2><p>I was able to propose this game to publishers during a &quot;speed dating&quot; style event at GenCon. I was chosen after submitting my one-page rundown of the game and since I was heading down there to play games, it was perfect timing.</p><p>Almost every publisher that saw the game loved it and was able actually play a round during the 2 or 3 minutes that we had to talk.</p><p>However everyone quickly realized the cost of creating Catapults. Each piece required a different mold since they each needed to be their own color. The publishers that saw the game didn't have the means to take this high of a risk.</p><h2>The Results</h2><p>This game is sitting in my basement, waiting to be played. I have several copies printed out and in baggies. I've since taken the official website down but you can see a backup copy of it <a href="https://kikketer.com/sites/catapults-game">here</a>.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__tags"><a href="/tags/board-game/">#board-game</a></div><nav class="post__pagination"><a href="/posts/card-studio/"><span>←</span> <span>Card Studio</span></a></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/Kikketer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul><p class="footer__attribution">Chris Weed 2021</p></div></footer></div><script src="/assets/main.31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c.js"></script></body></html>
