Given the struggles I had with GBStudio and GDevelop I thought I could give this platform a try, the biggest draws were the fact that I could write using TypeScript and it's actually something that could be played on a <a href="https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/meowbit-codable-console-for-microsoft-makecode-arcade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">handheld device</a>!</p><h2>Goals</h2><ol><li>Have the game be simple, my young daughter is the target audience</li><li>Have it be portable, she'd like to be able to play it while on the move</li><li>Have something to do with animals, she loves animals</li><li>Challenge me in terms of code level and graphics (also learn MakeCode Arcade)</li></ol><h2>Overall Game Challenges</h2><p>After some thought I decided to make the game a sort of "rescue" where instead of accepting dogs and cats you'd accept Pokemon characters. Bonus with these if you feed and keep them happy they could have the opportunity to grow (sorry I don't know the terms for the later level Pokemon).</p><p>Feeding the Pokemon is relatively simple but posed some solid programming challenges, mostly around "where is the Pokemon" and "are there other Pokemon in this same zone".</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/SCR-20250225-oufz.png" alt="" width="1390" height="1012" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-oufz-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>The Pokemon will feed if put into these pens, but not if there's more than one.</figcaption></figure><p>I ended up creating 3 "zones" where the Pokemon could feed and had to check all the other Pokemon to see if they are also within that zone. If there were more than just one in a specific zone then they wouldn't eat.</p><p>On the counter of the food, there's also a happiness level. This happiness level is decreased slowly while the Pokemon are not in the play area. This includes the food area, so they will slowly become less happy even while they eat. The game is to constantly move the Pokemon from the food to the play area to try and keep them fed and happy.</p><p>Other fun items added to the game include a computer (always wanted to make a computer interface inside of a computer interface) where I had to hand build a UI for the computer. It was surprisingly difficult to get the cursor to look and work naturally along with showing the data of all the Pokemon.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/SCR-20250225-ozri.png" alt="" width="500" height="373" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-ozri-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>User Interfaces look easy from a distance, but actually writing them is tricky</figcaption></figure><h3>Fast vs Slow "tick"</h3><p>Some of the overall game techniques I ended up discovering are things I'll likely use for future games. One of those is the aspect of a "fast" and "slow" tick.</p><p>Basically my goal was to reduce "forever" running blocks to update stats, move creatures and other time based things. I could have created a forever block in each creature or every other component, but to me that felt like it would slow the game down. So I created a global tick block:</p><p class="filename">main.ts</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/SCR-20250225-owxs.png" alt="" width="320" height="202" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-owxs-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>A "forever" block that triggers slow ticks for elements</figcaption></figure><p>I have a "slow" and "fast" which are the same except they have different pause levels but do the same sort of calls to the Critters and Events.  The Critters and Events loop over their own inventory of things (Critters for example keeps track of a list of critters in the game and propagates that event for each).</p><p>This of course does cause the slight angle of things either updating at the same time but I added some random "should I move" or "should I eat" per creature/element so the overall look is quite random and feels natural.</p><h2>Coding Experience</h2><p>The development environment for MakeCode Arcade is absolutely great. Their editor is completely online and I've actually been able to use it to teach a video game class!</p><p>The best part of their experience is the fact that you can move somewhat freely between block coding (which the kids love) and Typescript. This allows anyone to see some direct "how this looks" when you transition between the two. For me where I wouldn't touch block coding with a 10' pole, it actually was quite useful to learn what capabilities I could use within the framework.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/transition.png" alt="" width="320" height="259" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/transition-2xl.png 1920w"><figcaption>Blocks can easily become real Typescript code, and back again</figcaption></figure><p>I would use this transition between blocks and code quite a bit to learn how to build what I was going for. Eventually I was confident enough to know what global component to use for what. They have great typeahead as well and checking, but using the blocks to learn that `scene` is a global variable is great experience. I wonder if other frameworks could do something like this.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I realize that a lot of this isn't new to any vet game developer. This post (and this entire blog) is mostly for me to look back at some of the things I've built and the enjoyment I had building it.</p><p>The game is not actually complete at this point. There was quite a bit more I wanted to do such as actual adoptions baed on how happy the Pokemon were and their "level". But I found after playing it for awhile that the game actually wasn't much fun! I'm sure there's way to make everyday chores exciting, maybe there's something I could add to make this more exciting but I ran out of motivation.</p><p>Feel free to play the game however, it's a nice experience and may inspire the next amazing game!</p><div style="position: relative; height: 0; padding-bottom: 117.6%; overflow: hidden;"><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://arcade.makecode.com/---run?id=S26462-36447-03400-66973" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://cjweed.com/tags/learning/">learning</a></li><li><a href="https://cjweed.com/tags/videogame/">videogame</a></li></ul></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://cjweed.com/pokemon-rescue-gbstudio/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/8/responsive/PokemonGBCover-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="293" width="293"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Pokemon Rescue - GBStudio</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://cjweed.com/capacitor-supabase-social-auth-react/" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Capacitor + Supabase + Social Auth + React</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Supa-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Supabase, Capacitor, Google Logos" height="600" width="600"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 - Chris Weed</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://cjweed.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://cjweed.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
