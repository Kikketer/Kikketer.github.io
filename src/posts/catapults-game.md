Using the power of my 3D printers, I wanted to create a board game. Inspired by the NES game "..." I created a fun little game that can mostly be created by anyone with a 3D printer.

## The Game
Time to start writing stuff!

## Designing the Components
Boom

## Proposing to Publishers
I was able to propose this game to publishers during a "speed dating" style event at GenCon.  I was chosen after submitting my one-page rundown of the game and since I was heading down there to play games, it was perfect timing.

Almost every publisher that saw the game loved it and was able actually play a round during the 2 or 3 minutes that we had to talk.

However everyone quickly realized the cost of creating Catapults. Each piece required a different mold since they each needed to be their own color. The publishers that saw the game didn't have the means to take this high of a risk.

## The Results
This game is sitting in my basement, waiting to be played.  I have several copies printed out and in baggies.  I've since taken the official website down but you can see a backup copy of it [here](https://kikketer.com/sites/catapults-game).
