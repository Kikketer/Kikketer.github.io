we could in theory have this space clock stay completely still!</p><p><img class="lazyload blur-up" src="https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/First-Flight-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/First-Flight-xs.png 300w ,https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/First-Flight-sm.png 480w ,https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/First-Flight-md.png 768w" alt="" width="300" height="566"><img class="lazyload blur-up" src="https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/How-fast-xs.png" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/How-fast-xs.png 300w ,https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/How-fast-sm.png 480w ,https://Kikketer.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/How-fast-md.png 768w" alt="" width="300" height="700"></p><p>We know by looking at stars and such that we are moving thorugh the universe (fairly quickly).  Because we are moving that means we are also traveling through time at a different rate than someone else on a different planet or spaceship.  So we could kind of figure out how fast we are moving compared to "absolute zero speed" by comparing time between the "space clock" and the earth clock.</p><p>I realize this may not work obviously, I'm not at all an expert in this area but if anything it can trigger some thoughts in your head.</p><h4>Some References to Check Out:</h4><ul><li>A quick light travel/time travel video - <a href="https://Kikketer.github.io/making-android-clocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speed of Light (youtube)</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQC3ErD1YwE"><br></a></li><li>Genius by Stephen Hawking - <a href="https://app.curiositystream.com/video/1795/can-we-time-travel?utm_adgroup=genius%20by%20stephen%20hawking%20(Hawking)&amp;msclkid=bdb9c05d24b61281106a9a97f192dfeb&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=S-Titles-Beta&amp;utm_term=%2Bgenius%20%2Bby%20%2Bstephen%20%2Bhawking&amp;utm_content=genius%20by%20stephen%20hawking%20(Hawking)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Time travel with Stephen Hawking">Can We Time Travel?</a></li><li>Movie Interstellar - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></li></ul></div><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2FKikketer.github.io%2Fcan-you-stand-still%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://Kikketer.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2FKikketer.github.io%2Fcan-you-stand-still%2F" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://Kikketer.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg></a></aside><footer class="post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://Kikketer.github.io/tg/random_thoughts/">Random_Thoughts</a></li><li><a href="https://Kikketer.github.io/tg/thought_experiment/">Thought_Experiment</a></li></ul><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev">Previous Post<h5><a href="https://Kikketer.github.io/making-android-clocks/" class="inverse" rel="prev">Making Android Clocks</a></h5></div><div class="post__nav__next">Next Post<h5><a href="https://Kikketer.github.io/the-multiverse-and-consiousness/" class="inverse" rel="next">The Multiverse and Consciousness</a></h5></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer></div><script>var loadCSSFiles = function() {
