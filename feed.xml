      <p>Using the power of my 3D printers, I wanted to create a board game. Inspired by the NES game &quot;...&quot; I created a fun little game that can mostly be created by anyone with a 3D printer.</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>Time to start writing stuff!</p>
<h2>Designing the Components</h2>
<p>Boom</p>
<h2>Proposing to Publishers</h2>
<p>I was able to propose this game to publishers during a &quot;speed dating&quot; style event at GenCon.  I was chosen after submitting my one-page rundown of the game and since I was heading down there to play games, it was perfect timing.</p>
<p>Almost every publisher that saw the game loved it and was able actually play a round during the 2 or 3 minutes that we had to talk.</p>
<p>However everyone quickly realized the cost of creating Catapults. Each piece required a different mold since they each needed to be their own color. The publishers that saw the game didn't have the means to take this high of a risk.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>This game is sitting in my basement, waiting to be played.  I have several copies printed out and in baggies.  I've since taken the official website down but you can see a backup copy of it <a href="https://kikketer.com/sites/catapults-game">here</a>.</p>

      <p>I was helping my son create a new board game and was looking for an easy way to generate cards using CSV data.  This is a small desktop (electron) app that kind of works.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Kikketer/CardStudio">Repo</a></p>
<h2>Card Studio Idea</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/card-studio-shot.png" alt="Card Studio Overview"></p>
<p>There are many days where my son will attempt to build a board game. I love this since I've attempted this same thing many many times without much success (see <a href="./skylight-game">Skylight Game</a> and <a href="./catapults-game">Catapults Game</a>).  He proposed this pretty fantastic and simple game based on his love for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/92037-wings-of-fire">Wings of Fire</a>.</p>
<p>During the creation of the game I wanted to have a way to quickly generate the playing cards.  I know that <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com">The Game Crafter</a> created an application called <a href="https://component.studio/">Component Studio</a> which serves the purpose of building game components. This product has a monthly fee and since I change projects nearly daily, it didn't make much sense financially.</p>
<p>But I'm cheap and I like to build things. I decided to attempt to build a desktop version of the application with the intent that this is free, easy and gets the job done well enough.</p>
<h2>The Goals</h2>
<p>The goals were simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow the user to build a &quot;master&quot; template of the cards</li>
<li>Read a CSV document to generate the cards</li>
<li>Allow the use of a drag/drop style interaction to design the cards</li>
<li>Run entirely on the desktop, allowing a user to have a project that could be easily shared (think Github)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The User Flow</h3>
<p>A user would open a &quot;project&quot; file, likely a JSON5 document (I love JSON5). This project file would have all the needed meta-data like project title and the like but also the definitions and descriptions for each &quot;deck&quot;.</p>
<p>The user then would be able to edit the &quot;master&quot; file of a deck which is sort of like a template for the entire deck. Using a specially crafted variable input they would be able to use the values that existed in the CSV document.</p>
<p>Lastly the user would be able to click the &quot;generate&quot; button and would get a series of images that are &quot;Game Crafter ready&quot; that they could use to upload or print.</p>
<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>Through building this application I used the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>: The foundation to make your web application be a desktop application. This technique isn't new and is used by many applications today.</li>
<li><a href="https://konvajs.org/">Konva</a>: A great canvas library that allows you to draw on an HTML canvas.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../images/card-studio-drag-drop.gif" alt="Drag and Drop in Konva"></p>
<h2>The &quot;Conclusion&quot;</h2>
<p>I've since moved away from this project since new things have landed on my plate.  The game did make it all the way to <a href="https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/dragon-world">The Game Crafter</a> but didn't use Card Studio directly.</p>
<p>I did however generate the cards used in the game using the same tools, I just didn't use the IDE that I was intending to build.</p>
<p>Lastly this project is a bit paused right now mostly because I've not updated my OS on my MacBook Air and it seems the SASS dependencies no longer compile for the project.</p>
<h2>The Learnings</h2>
<p>I had a couple ah-ha moments when I realized that I could use a standard mindset of a network API to generate the cards without having to view the page each time.</p>
<p>Previous adventures in this type of thing required me to render the entire card on a visible HTML page to export it as a .png file. This involved an annoying process of having to click each card and then click a &quot;download&quot; button.</p>
<p>The solution was to have the cards render on the &quot;client&quot; (renderer) but hidden and their base64 encoded result would be sent to the &quot;backend&quot; (main) of Electron. From there the file can be saved directly to the file system.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/card-studio-to-64.png" alt="Output using base64"></p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>I do plan to continue working on this fun project but I always need more inspiration. My kids are the source of all my inspiration and I'll likely come back to this project once my son decides to build yet another game.</p>
