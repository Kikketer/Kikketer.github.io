Supabase acts as the middle-person that allows us to get a Supabase Authentication token using Google. Basically the user is able to authenticate to your Supabase app using their Google auth. The real trick is getting the OS to launch the Capacitor native app vs the web page (using Universal Links).</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/AuthFlow.webp" height="450" width="651" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-xs.webp 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-sm.webp 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-md.webp 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-lg.webp 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-xl.webp 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/AuthFlow-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><h2 id="baseline-ionic-web-application">Baseline Ionic Web Application</h2><p>Feel free to jump to the Ionic documentation around creating an app, I'll walk through the high level steps but read their docs to really get a more accurate procedure and reasoning behind them:&nbsp;<a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli</a></p><p>I hate having libraries install things globally to my system, drives me crazy. So if you want to do as I do, add the node_modules/.bin to your path by editing your `.zshrc` file and put this at the bottom:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html"><code>export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
</code></pre><p>Then initialize the application, you can use most any package manager but I tend to like pnpm these days:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>pnpm init
</code></pre><p>This will create the package.json in your application and now you can do the steps described (mostly) in the Ionic setup. First let's install the CLI so we can use their nice app creation wizard:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>pnpm i -D @ionic/cli</code></pre><p>And now that we've updated our path we should be able to simply run the CLI commands directly in this folder and it didn't mess with our host system. Follow the steps in the Ionic setup cli, this will create another folder in our current folder but that's ok for now, we will move it:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>ionic start</code></pre><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>1. Use the app creation wizard? No &lt;&lt; Don't bother with their online thing
2. React   | https://reactjs.org &lt;&lt; Pick React (cuz I know that one)
3. Project name: WTF App &lt;&lt; App name, whatever you want
4. blank        | A blank starter project &lt;&lt; Blank to stay simple</code></pre><p>Unfortunately it'll also attempt to do the install of node_modules with npm and we also have a nested folder. This side effect is still worth the trouble vs having the cli installed globally.&nbsp; So let's do some cleanup:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>rm -rf ./**/node_modules &lt;&lt; Wipe out all the node_modules folders for now
mv wtf-app/* . &lt;&lt; Moves the nested folder components here (overwrite is fine)
rm -rf wtf-app &lt;&lt; Wipe out the empty folder
pnpm i &lt;&lt; install the dependencies again</code></pre><p>You should now see index.html, package.json etc in this original folder. Phew that was a little crazy but we are in a good spot to move forward now. You should be able to run the following command and see the application running in your browser:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash"><code>pnpm i -D @ionic/cli &lt;&lt; only need to run this the first time to get the CLI back
ionic serve</code></pre><p>Congrats you have a baseline Ionic app running (same result as the tutorial they provide):&nbsp;<a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli</a></p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/Blank-Ionic-2.png" height="549" width="320" alt="A blank ionic web application" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Blank-Ionic-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><h2 id="supabase-auth-setup">Supabase Auth Setup</h2><p>We need to setup a simple Supabase application, in this case we are only going to worry about authentication. Once you have that out of the way building the rest of your app can be really easy and fun.</p><p>We will be following the tutorial that Supabase provides here:&nbsp;<a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=platform&amp;platform=web&amp;queryGroups=environment&amp;environment=client" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=platform&amp;platform=web&amp;queryGroups=environment&amp;environment=client</a><br>We will be following the "Application Code" path where we are going to provide our own button and logic to handle that button.</p><p>First off we need to create the application within Supabase. Creating an account and project is super easy. After signup (come now I shouldn't have to show you how to do that) you need to create a new project:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-iite-2.png" height="183" width="400" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iite-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>After you create the project we need to go to the Authentication section and setup our website redirect url. This is the url for our app, so for example you might do something like `https://app.isawesome.zone/logged` or the like. I put the `/logged` at the end because that's where we will send users with our authentication information once they sign in.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-iioc.png" height="1298" width="1656" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-iioc-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Now we need to create the application within Google itself!

Basically you authenticate with Google, and there's a transaction that happens between Supabase and Google to give you a resulting Supabase token which you can then use to query your Supabase databases!</p><p>Note however that we do NOT have the ability to use the Google authentication to use Google services. That's a bonus feature I'm going to leave up to you. Be aware that I wasn't able to get that half of it working with the Capacitor app (there are other limitations too).</p><h2 id="adding-sign-in-with-google-button">Adding Sign In With Google Button</h2><p>Now that we have Supabase auth setup we need to put it into our actual code. Again I'm using the "roll your own" technique vs the "one tap" login. I'm doing this mostly as a design aspect but also as a more universal learning so this could be applied to other social logins like Facebook.&nbsp; We will be somewhat following the basic tutorial steps provided by Supabase:&nbsp;<a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=platform&amp;platform=web&amp;queryGroups=environment&amp;environment=client#signing-users-in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google?queryGroups=platform&amp;platform=web&amp;queryGroups=environment&amp;environment=client#signing-users-in</a></p><p>First let's create a Supabase provider that will handle setting up Supabase and provide the `supabase` functionality to components:</p><p class="filename">components/SupabaseProvider.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import { createContext, ReactNode, useContext, FC, useState } from 'react'
import { createClient, SupabaseClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabaseKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY
const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL

const SupabaseContext = createContext&lt;{ supabase: SupabaseClient } | null&gt;(null)

interface SupabaseProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

export const SupabaseProvider: FC&lt;SupabaseProviderProps&gt; = ({
  children,
}) =&gt; {
  const [supabase] = useState&lt;SupabaseClient&gt;(() =&gt;
    createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey),
  )

  return (
    &lt;SupabaseContext.Provider value={{ supabase }}&gt;
      {children}
    &lt;/SupabaseContext.Provider&gt;
  )
}

export const useSupabase = () =&gt; {
  const context = useContext(SupabaseContext)
  if (context === null) {
    throw new Error('useSupabase must be used within a SupabaseProvider')
  }
  return context
}
</code></pre><p>Notice I provide a hook at the bottom of the file to consume this provider. I like using custom hooks to use providers vs the raw `useContext`, it just makes things clearer and allows us to throw exceptions easily if it's not used properly.</p><p>With that let's also create a `&lt;LoginComponent&gt;` that simply has the button and handles the click for that button:</p><p class="filename">components/LoginComponent.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import { IonButton } from '@ionic/react'
import { useSupabase } from './SupabaseProvider'

const baseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL

const LoginComponent = () =&gt; {
  const { supabase } = useSupabase()

  const login = () =&gt; {
    supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
      provider: 'google',
      options: {
        redirectTo: `${baseUrl}/logged`,
        queryParams: {
          access_type: 'offline',
          prompt: 'consent',
        },
      },
    })
  }

  return (
    &lt;div id="login"&gt;
      &lt;IonButton onClick={login}&gt;Log In with Google&lt;/IonButton&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export default LoginComponent
</code></pre><p>See how nice that looks with the hook?&nbsp; If we really wanted to get fancy we could/would provide more helper functionality out of the hook/provider such as `signIn` but for now let's keep it simple.</p><p>Notice how I also use the `import.meta.env` to get environment variables. These are used to bring the environment variables into a Vite application. When it's built these are injected and can be changed based on what you are building the application for. That's a hint for your potential future if you ever need to do a specific build for Capacitor vs Web (we won't be doing that here).</p><p>And now let's use that component in our Home.tsx page:</p><p class="filename">pages/Home.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import {
  IonContent,
  IonHeader,
  IonPage,
  IonTitle,
  IonToolbar,
} from '@ionic/react'

const Home: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;IonPage&gt;
      &lt;IonHeader&gt;
        &lt;IonToolbar&gt;
          &lt;IonTitle&gt;Auth Test&lt;/IonTitle&gt;
        &lt;/IonToolbar&gt;
      &lt;/IonHeader&gt;
      &lt;IonContent fullscreen&gt;
        &lt;IonHeader collapse="condense"&gt;
          &lt;IonToolbar&gt;
            &lt;IonTitle size="large"&gt;Auth Test&lt;/IonTitle&gt;
          &lt;/IonToolbar&gt;
        &lt;/IonHeader&gt;
        &lt;LoginComponent /&gt;
      &lt;/IonContent&gt;
    &lt;/IonPage&gt;
  )

export default Home
</code></pre><p>This is exactly the same as the stock Ionic Home page except we have brought in the new LoginComponent we just built.</p><p>We need one final component: the debug component so we can see that all of this works. Create a new component called DebugComponent.tsx:</p><p class="filename">components/DebugComponent.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { useSupabase } from './SupabaseProvider'
import { User } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export const DebugComponent = () =&gt; {
  const [user, setUser] = useState&lt;User | undefined&gt;()
  const { supabase } = useSupabase()

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const getUser = async () =&gt; {
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
      if (error) {
        console.log(error)
      } else {
        setUser(data.user)
      }
    }
    getUser()
  }, [supabase])

  return (
    &lt;div id="debug"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Debug Info:&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;User&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;{JSON.stringify(user ?? {}, null, 2)}&lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre><p>This component is super basic and really just serves the purpose of showing us the logged in user. Similar to the LoginComponent we could have had some of this user logic handled by the useSupabase hook/provider but let's keep it simple and clear again. So far your structure should look similar to this:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-markdown"><code>/app
  /src
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
    /components
      DebugComponent.tsx
      LoginComponent.tsx
    /pages
      Home.tsx</code></pre><p>Let's create a new page called LoggedIn so we can have two routes. Remember when we setup the redirect url we said `/logged` was the page we wished to land on. That's what we will make here:</p><p class="filename">pages/LoggedIn.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import {
  IonButton,
  IonButtons,
  IonContent,
  IonHeader,
  IonPage,
  IonTitle,
  IonToolbar,
} from '@ionic/react'
import { DebugComponent } from '../components/DebugComponent'
import { useSupabase } from '../components/SupabaseProvider'
import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'

export const LoggedIn = () =&gt; {
  const history = useHistory()
  const { supabase } = useSupabase()

  const signOut = async () =&gt; {
    await supabase.auth.signOut()
    history.push('/')
  }

  return (
    &lt;IonPage&gt;
      &lt;IonHeader&gt;
        &lt;IonToolbar&gt;
          &lt;IonTitle&gt;Logged In&lt;/IonTitle&gt;
          &lt;IonButtons slot="end"&gt;
            &lt;IonButton onClick={signOut}&gt;Sign Out&lt;/IonButton&gt;
          &lt;/IonButtons&gt;
        &lt;/IonToolbar&gt;
      &lt;/IonHeader&gt;
      &lt;IonContent fullscreen&gt;
        &lt;IonHeader collapse="condense"&gt;
          &lt;IonToolbar&gt;
            &lt;IonTitle size="large"&gt;Logged in&lt;/IonTitle&gt;
          &lt;/IonToolbar&gt;
        &lt;/IonHeader&gt;
        &lt;DebugComponent /&gt;
      &lt;/IonContent&gt;
    &lt;/IonPage&gt;
  )
}
</code></pre><p>Nothing fancy to this page, we are simply rendering the Sign Out button with an onClick handler but also rendering the Debug component so we can see the authenticated user when we land here.</p><p>Now let's setup the routing in App.tsx</p><p class="filename">pages/App.tsx</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import { Redirect, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

This will end the local server and free us up a little bit for the next steps.</p><h2 id="setting-up-capacitor">Setting Up Capacitor</h2><p>First off we need to get Capacitor setup for iOS and all the environment settings. We will be following the instructions here:&nbsp;<a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup</a></p><p>Since we will be building an iOS app I'll be focusing on getting that half setup. Adding Android isn't so bad and may be the topic for a future tutorial.</p><p>To build an iOS app you unfortunately need an Apple Developer account which costs $99/year! It seriously took me about 8 years to really push myself over that cliff but it's a great way to inspire getting an app built and into the store. You can sign up for an account here:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/account" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.apple.com/account</a></p><p>Once you have an account created, download and install Xcode:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://developer.apple.com/download/applications/</a></p><p>After installing Xcode, let's not open it yet and instead dive back to our app code. First we will install Capacitor in our app:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm i @capacitor/core @capacitor/ios
pnpm i -D @capacitor/cli</code></pre><p>With that we need to initialize Capacitor, this will create a couple files we need that helps build the project files for iOS:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm exec cap init</code></pre><p>Before we add some of the iOS specific items we need to setup the Capacitor config file:</p><p class="filename">app/capacitor.config.ts</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>import type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli'

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'zone.wtft',
  appName: 'WTFT Zone',
  webDir: 'dist',
}

export default config</code></pre><p>Most of that file may be the same as what's there already but you'll want to modify the appId and appName.</p><p>Now we can finally add the Capacitor iOS capabilities:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm i @capacitor/ios
</code></pre><p>Then run the build on the application to make it create the `/dist` folder:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm run build</code></pre><p>With the latest Capacitor there's an option to use the official Swift Package Manager vs Cocoapods. As of this writing it's still experimental but since there's not an obvious way to convert applications (yet) and we aren't using any 3rd party plugins we can confidently use this today. If you are using 3rd party plugins or have other oddities you might add in the future you may want to stick to Cocoapods for now.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm exec cap add ios --packagemanager SPM</code></pre><p>One last step before we open Xcode is to build and sync our application. This build and sync is something you'll have to do quite often because any changes to your application need to be bundled up and then placed into the native app. Get used to this command (you could even create a custom script in the package.json to make this easier/shorter):</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm run build && pnpm exec cap sync</code></pre><p>And now we can finally open Xcode with our nice project:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm exec cap open ios</code></pre><p>That command will open Xcode with your workspace file. You don't always have to use that to open it, in the future you can simply just open Xcode and the workspace folder manually (or in the previously opened workspaces).</p><p>To run our application in a simulator click the dropdown and pick iPhone SE. Why? Well when I'm developing mobile/web apps I find that it's always best to run it on the slowest/oldest hardware that you officially support. This will help expose any performance or design issues you may have right away (simulators have the power of your laptop so performance isn't as realistic as it would be on a real device).</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-rxax.png" height="432" width="1282" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-rxax-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Once you've selected the simulator press the play button and watch the magic!</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-suhx.png" height="625" width="800" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-suhx-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>But wait you say. The auth is not sending me back to my own app.. it's sending me to a broken localhost page! Yes that's correct, remember we killed our local server but also even if it was running we'd simply land on that page.</p><p>Give it a try once, fire up the local server again:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>pnpm run dev</code></pre><p>And then try to authenticate with the simulator again. You'll land on the logged page for that website, not back in your native app 😔. This is where Deep Links or as Apple calls them "Universal Links" comes into play.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/back-to-localhost.gif" height="619" width="320" alt=""></figure><h2 id="deep-links-and-universal-links">Deep Links and Universal Links</h2><p>Deep Links allow you to have a simple url that opens up a native app if it's installed or just the website. Deep Links provide a great security measure compared to old app-like domains since there's a verification step to claim the domain and prove that it's yours. A good portion of this follows the Capacitor tutorial:&nbsp;<a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deep-links" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deep-links</a></p><p>We will use Deep Links (or Universal Links as Apple likes to call them) to our app to allow the redirect that we get from the Google Authentication flow to open our app. This is a little complicated due to those security measures but worth it!</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Deep links do NOT work for every browser! If you are using Orion, Brave or other "off-brand" browsers the Deep Links may not actually open the native app. For this reason I half-feel this authentication procedure is not entirely the best but it's good for simple apps. Please be aware of this if you are building a production level app!<br><br>Even if you don't use Deep Links for authentication in the future it's still good to have for your application for general use. So these steps aren't wasted if you move to a more robust authentication procedure.<br></p><p>Universal Links (I'll just use that term from now on) require the use of a special file on a website to allow Apple to validate that you own the domain. So first we need to build a website! We will use Github Pages for this purpose. If you want an example app to look at you can see it at my repo:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Kikketer/wtftzone/tree/main/packages/website" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Kikketer/wtftzone/tree/main/packages/website</a></p><p class="msg msg--highlight">You will need to have a custom domain for this procedure to work. I've tried with just the &lt;username&gt;.github.io and it seems to cause issues for many users.

Let's create a new file:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-svmd.png" height="876" width="1806" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-svmd-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>We will then create the `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` file:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-szdj.png" height="241" width="500" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-szdj-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Then we will paste in the following:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>{
  "applinks": {
    "apps": [],
    "details": [
      {
        "appID": "&lt;app id&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;",
        "paths": [
          "*"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
</code></pre><p>You will need to change the appID to be what your site is. The app id comes from the Apple App we created earlier:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-tavt.png" height="830" width="1668" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tavt-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>The resulting item should look something like:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>"appID": "PV2C5M6W98.wtft.zone",</code></pre><p>We need to create one more file in our repo so that we can tie our repo to the real domain we've purchased. Create a "CNAME" file (no extension):</p><p class="filename">CNAME</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>wtft.zone</code></pre><p>This gives Github the information it needs to tie your purchased domain to this site and that it should be used in this repo. Before we are through here though let's make a very basic html page so we know the site is working:</p><p class="filename">index.html</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Basic Site&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre><p>Your resulting repository should look something like this:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>.well-known/
  apple-app-site-association
CNAME
index.html</code></pre><p>Next we need to verify with Github that we own the custom domain. So head over to the global Settings &gt; Pages:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/settings/pages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/settings/pages</a>&nbsp;within Github.</p><p>Click "Add Domain" and enter your domain</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-tpim-2.png" height="230" width="400" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tpim-2-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Github will then give you instructions on what records to add to your domain register. I'm using Porkbun but yours may look different than this but the IP addresses, CNAME and TXT entries would look similar:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-tnlf.png" height="866" width="1744" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tnlf-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>The IPs that you want your A type in the domain would be these (mostly here so you can copy/paste):</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
</code></pre><p>Back in Github you should pretty quickly see that it's able to verify your domain:</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-trhp.png" height="121" width="320" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-trhp-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>This means you can now use this domain in our repository, so lets head back to the repo and go to Settings &gt; Pages within that specific repository. You can now enter in the custom domain we've verified.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/SCR-20250222-tlym.png" height="1116" width="1750" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-xs.png 640w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-sm.png 768w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-md.png 1024w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-lg.png 1366w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-xl.png 1600w, https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/responsive/SCR-20250222-tlym-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p>Hopefully quickly it'll verify your domain. However the HTTPS portion of the domain won't be instant. This may take up to a day so this is a great opportunity to get up and stretch your legs (same for me).</p><p>Once it's verified you should be able to navigate to your domain and see that boring html page we created! Even better test is to navigate to the `.well-known/apple-app-site-association` location where it'll attempt to download the file. That means we are good to go with linking our app to this domain!</p><h2 id="associate-the-app">Associate the App</h2><p>We will be following the tutorial:&nbsp;<a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deep-links" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/guides/deep-links</a></p><p>Back in Xcode we need to now leverage all of these things we've built to allow our app to use the Universal Link and domain verification we've done.

Release:

Remember the original issue we had where we were being redirected to localhost, well now we want to be redirected to our custom domain.</p><p>The easiest way is to simply alter your `.env.local` file but I find that annoying when you are developing the app in the browser and the simulator. So I put a custom script in my package.json file to do the build and sync for me each time:</p><p class="filename">package.json</p><pre class="line-numbers language-jsx"><code>"sync": "VITE_BASE_URL=https://wtft.zone pnpm run build && pnpm exec cap sync",</code></pre><p>That command is run via `pnpm run sync` which will set the environment variable for the base url, build the application then sync it to the native app. Then all you need to do is re-run the native app in Xcode.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/3/app-last.gif" height="619" width="320" alt=""></figure><p>Did you see that?

But with the goal of "no extra code for native app" and "simple side-projects" this seems to work fairly well. If anything it gets you into a good position to do the extra steps of native-specific authentication.</p><p>Here's a list of things I've come across so far, this list may grow/shrink as I adjust and learn:</p><ul><li>There are some browsers that will not launch the native apps using Universal Links. Orion and Brave are two that I know of. That should/would account for a tiny percentage of the population but it's difficult/tricky to know if the user is unable to use your native app because they will simply land on a working page on the web instead of the app.</li><li>This only works with the "prompt: 'confirm'" option in the Google provider options. It appears that Universal Links do not trigger and load the native app if it's from a redirect. So the extra step process of the confirm windows in the browser allow the Universal Link to work properly.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id="credits-and-references">Credits and References</h2><ul><li>Ionic Docs:&nbsp;<a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ionicframework.com/docs/</a></li><li>Capacitor Docs:&nbsp;<a href="https://capacitorjs.com/docs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://capacitorjs.com/docs/</a></li><li>Supabase Docs:&nbsp;<a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/reactjs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/reactjs</a></li><li>Capacitor + Android Inspiration:&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/setting-up-supabase-google-oauth-with-capacitor-android/234165" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/setting-up-supabase-google-oauth-with-capacitor-android/234165</a></li></ul></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://cjweed.com/tags/learning/">learning</a></li><li><a href="https://cjweed.com/tags/tutorial/">tutorial</a></li><li><a href="https://cjweed.com/tags/web/">web</a></li></ul></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://cjweed.com/pokemon-rescue-makecode-arcade/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://cjweed.com/media/posts/2/responsive/SCR-20250225-pbvz-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="A pixelart video game made in MakeCode Arcade with Pokemon" height="1174" width="1174"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> Pokemon Rescue - MakeCode Arcade</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2025 - Chris Weed</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://cjweed.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://cjweed.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
